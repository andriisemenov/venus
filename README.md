This is a home for The Venus Project's requirements as a system

Every engineering solution first needs a number of requirements to design around. Before the rocket flies, the engineering team has to build and study multitude of small solutions
and subsystems: the engine has to output this much power, the structure should be made from this material, etc. Building and testing modules separately ensures the rocket will
reach it's destination. 

Every system consists of modules. Modules can be developed and tested simultaneously. The Venus Project as a system contains multitude of modules, which can be sybsystems themselves. 
Example of a module that can be a separate system is a human. It is part of the complete project and at the same time it contains many small systems and parts: health, education,
behavior, etc. In order to design a system, we first need to understand the requirements of this design. The requirements in the engineering world are pulled from different stakeholders.
For consumer product, for example, a feel or a need is turned into the requirement. 

Since The Venus Project is a sulution and a design that will benefit all, we all are stakeholders. We are responsible for the design of the world we will live in. This is why this
repository is created here, on GitHub. We can make use of many tools which are already available, such as "Issues" for discussions, branches for developing new features and requirements. 
And since GitHub is already used in engineering, we can share code, hardware and architecture design here on GitHub, facilitating open-source development of the Venus Project.
