Hi TVP! 
I'm a fan of TVP for a long time, however, never posted here anything before. Watched documentaries of RBE and Jacque Fresco interviews since I was around 10 y.o.. Now I have an education as a software and hardware engineer. 

In short, I want to propose to use GitHub to develop TVP blueprints, which can later be used by governments/institutions. 

For those not familiar with it: GitHub is a collaboration/code tracking platform, where many organizations host their code and intellectual resources. Usually, when engineering solution is designed, GitHub (or similar) is used for team to collaborate and track code changes. It is also widely used for open-source code collaboration.

Benefits: 
1. Collaboration 
    GitHub enables collaboration without influence on the source. Branches can be created from the main trunk. The branch is then changed or changes added to the branch. Then this branch can be merged to the main trunk by TVP moderator.
2. TVP structure clarity
    TVP is a vision, that applies holistic approach to solving important societal problems. Since the society has to be redesigned, we need to view the world as a system. The world and society are not easy to redesign. These are big systems with a variety of variables. From engineering perspective it is best to split the system into modules or subsystems. The solutions can be presented for each module. Each module can be developed and tested simultaneously. Therefore, we can split the GitHub repository into separate folders/modules. Individual collaborators can then contribute to the individual modules. A healthcare worker, for example, can contribute to the healthcare module of TVP.
3. Easy methodology tracking
    The world is changing fast. Solutions which were presented 10 years ago lose their up to date status. TVP as a global solution will be changed as well many times until it will be able to support its initial claims. Testing of individual modules will bring learnings which will enhance initial design. Therefore, we need to be able to track the changes in the solution. This is covered by using GitHub. When implementing a change to original design we can still look at how the solution was build previously. Essentially, this allows for tracking TVP as a living document.

I have created a repository on GitHub as a demo, please find the link below:

Example of how the healthcare subsystem can be described:

Since GitHub is used for engineering a lot, It also can be used to create and enable collaboration for opensource AI government and other technical solutions required by TVP.


Let me know what you think!
